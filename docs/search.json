This can be either very short analytical process or long tedious process. This can include:\n\nGathering Data\nData Preprocessing\n\nCleaining, normalizing or standardizing data\n\nModel building\nAnalytical inference and results\n\n2. What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nAnswer:\n\nSimilarities\n\nBoth rely on Statistical theories and methods\nBoth focus on reproducibility and accuracy\n\nDifferences\n\nApplication areas are totally different.\nTools used are different. Data Scientist can use ML Libraries whereas statistician use specialized software.\n\n\n3. How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\nAnswer:\nI see myself as bridge between both of them. I have specialization in Programming and intrest in statistic. And we know Data Scientist is someone who’s better in coding than Statistician and better at Statistics than Computer Scientist."
